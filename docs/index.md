# MarkdownTest â€“ to see how a topic looks
  
**DO NOT TRUST ANYTHING ON THIS SITE** - this for the GenevaERS team to test how markdown topics look.
 
Template topic is: [SampleMD](SampleMD.md). Please **COPY** the lines in that file to your new topic.
 
Place your new topic in the **docs** folder and then commit & merge. 
When you have finished testing, please delete your topic.
**Please do not touch "index.md" and "Sample.md".**

This website uses Jekyll software, and the theme "Just-the-Docs".  Deafening applause for the developers.
