# MarkdownTest
Test the appearance of markdown topics

Basic idea: 
1.  Create a topic (say MyTopic.md) in the docs folder.
2.  See Sample.MD for ideas on how to code the topic.  TopicA and TopicB show some links between topics.
3.  Stage, commit and merge into the repo.
4.  View your new topic on https://genevaers.github.io/MarkdownTest/.
5.  Make changes to your topic, or delete when done.
